# My first project using Javascript

* Date : 07/2023
* Done in : 2 hours
* Languages used : JS, html

## Purpose of the project
The html is a todolist, where I can:
* Add item
* Delete items
* Search for items
---
This is just the first project I've started self-learning. 
I've done this one with the help of the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i37KVt_IcXw) 

I've also looked into how to create an appropriate README.md.

## Why would I share such a mediocre project? 
I keep coding and store my works on Github so I can share with you my progression. If you have any feedbacks, please don't hesitate to send a message! :smile:
